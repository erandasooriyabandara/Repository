Repository API/SPI and Implementation

This is the Repository API/SPI and implementation for the carbon-kernel of C5.

It contains the API, SPI and a JDBC implementation of the API/SPI. 

Note that API is still subjected to change. The implementation is almost complete an we provide no guarantee in using in this form
as it's still subjected to change. There are few more additions and modifications to be done.

Hope this will be useful in some form to develop your middleware application.

Thanks
